Time-Series Analysis

This repository contains the R Markdown, and knitted PDF of the markdown file for this assignment. The Server.R, UI.R, and Datasets (CSV Files) used to create and deploy a Shiny app are in the "Lab 3" folder. 

The data is in it's own folder within the Lab 3 folder, this is so that there is no requirement to use a local working directory import the csv files and allows for the app to be launched online instead of just run locally on R Studio. 

I recommend keeping the CSV files in the "data" folder so the application can be easily replicated.

The link to the app is https://filipe-soares.shinyapps.io/Lab3/

Enjoy!
